# Web Research

Guidelines for research tasks that involve gathering and synthesizing information from multiple sources.

## MAARS Context

**No live web search**: The Executor uses ReadArtifact (dependency outputs) and ReadFile (local files). Use provided artifacts and general knowledge. If the task expects external data (e.g. "search the web for X"), document assumptions and note that live search was not available.

## Research Process

1. **Define scope**: Clarify what information is needed, from which domains, and what format the output should take.
2. **Gather sources**: Use ReadArtifact for dependency outputs; ReadFile for local files. Extract key points from each.
3. **Synthesize**: Combine findings. Note agreements, conflicts, and gaps. Use tables for side-by-side comparison.
4. **Cite**: When referencing sources from input artifacts, include clear attribution (e.g. [Source Name], [Author, Year]).

## Synthesis Techniques

- **Thematic synthesis**: Group findings by theme or topic. Preferred when many sources.
- **Comparative synthesis**: Side-by-side table when comparing options (technologies, approaches).
- **Chronological**: When timeline or evolution matters.
- **Gap analysis**: What is known vs unknown; recommend next steps.
- **Pro-con synthesis**: Aggregate pros/cons across sources when comparing alternatives.

## Output Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Findings | Organized by topic or source. Use subsections. |
| Summary | Key takeaways in bullet or paragraph form. |
| Gaps | What could not be determined; limitations. |
| Recommendations | Next steps, conclusions, or suggested actions. |

## Handling Conflicting Sources

When sources disagree:
- Present both views with attribution.
- Note the conflict explicitly.
- If possible, suggest resolution (e.g. "more recent", "broader sample").
- Do not arbitrarily pick one; let the reader see the conflict.

## Sandbox Usage

- Save intermediate notes to `sandbox/notes.md`
- Store raw or structured data to `sandbox/data.json` if needed
- Draft sections in `sandbox/draft.md` before finalizing
- Final output via Finish tool

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Findings organized logically
- [ ] Sources attributed when from input artifacts
- [ ] Summary captures main points
- [ ] Gaps/limitations acknowledged when relevant
- [ ] Recommendations actionable when appropriate
- [ ] Conflicts between sources noted when present
