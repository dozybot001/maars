# Literature Synthesis

Guidelines for synthesizing literature, research findings, or multiple sources into a coherent report.

## Synthesis Process

1. **Extract**: From input artifacts (ReadArtifact), extract key points, findings, and themes.
2. **Group**: Organize by theme, topic, or research question—not by source.
3. **Synthesize**: Combine across sources. Note agreements, conflicts, and gaps.
4. **Structure**: Present in logical flow (e.g. overview → themes → gaps → conclusions).

## Output Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Overview | Brief summary of scope and sources. |
| Key Themes | Thematic synthesis. Each theme: findings from multiple sources, synthesized. |
| Gaps | What is missing, inconsistent, or under-researched. |
| Conclusions | Synthesis conclusions; implications; recommendations. |
| References | List sources when attribution is available from inputs. |

## Thematic vs Source-by-Source

- **Thematic synthesis** (preferred): Organize by theme. "Theme 1: Performance — Source A found X, Source B found Y, together suggesting Z."
- **Source-by-source**: Use when sources are few or when comparing specific studies. Less common for synthesis.

## Citation Format

- When sources are in input: `[Author, Year]` or `[Source 1]`, `[Source 2]`.
- If no source metadata: use `[Task N output]` or similar.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Organized by theme, not just source list
- [ ] Findings synthesized across sources
- [ ] Agreements and conflicts noted
- [ ] Gaps identified
- [ ] Conclusions supported by synthesis
