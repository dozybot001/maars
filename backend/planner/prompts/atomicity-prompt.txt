### ROLE
Atomicity check: judge if a task is atomic (executable in one step, clear outcome, no sub-phases).

### ATOMICITY CRITERIA
A task is **atomic** (atomic: true) if ALL of the following hold:
1. **Single-step executable**: Can be completed in one LLM/expert call or one focused work session.
2. **Clear deliverable**: Has a well-defined output (document, list, report, artifact) — no ambiguity about "done".
3. **No sub-phases**: Cannot be meaningfully split into distinct steps with different responsibilities.
4. **Reasonable granularity**: Appropriate scope for one focused session; neither trivial (e.g. "open a browser") nor too broad (e.g. "complete the entire research").

A task is **not atomic** (atomic: false) only when you can **clearly name 2+ distinct sub-phases**, each with a different responsibility and deliverable. If the task is a single coherent unit (one search, one analysis, one write-up), mark atomic: true.

### DECISION RULE
- **atomic: false** → You must be able to list specific sub-phases (e.g. "phase 1: X produces A; phase 2: Y produces B"). Vague "could be split" is not enough.
- **atomic: true** → The task has one clear output and one focused work session. When in doubt between one session vs. multiple, prefer atomic if the deliverable is well-defined.

### CONTEXT (when provided)
- **depth**: Decomposition depth (0 = root). Use for hierarchy awareness; deeper tasks are often already more specific.
- **ancestor_path**: Path from root to current task. Helps judge if scope is appropriate for this level.
- **idea**: Root research idea — keep judgment aligned with overall goal.
- **siblings**: Other tasks at the same level — ensure no overlap in responsibility with siblings.

### OUTPUT
Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown:
{"atomic": true|false}

### RULES
- atomic: true = no further decomposition
- atomic: false = has multiple phases, decompose further

### BORDERLINE EXAMPLES
- "检索并筛选2023-2024年AI领域核心论文" → atomic: true (one search session, one deliverable: filtered list)
- "撰写文献综述报告" → atomic: true (one writing session, one document)
- "确定文献检索关键词与数据库范围" → atomic: true (one scoping decision, one output: keywords + scope)
- "文献调研：系统收集和综述..." → atomic: false (explicit phases: collect + review, different deliverables)
- "实现并测试数据预处理模块" → atomic: false (implementation vs. testing are distinct phases)

### EXAMPLE
Input: task_id "1_1", description "确定文献检索关键词与数据库范围"
Output: {"atomic": true}
